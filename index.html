                    <h3>Smart agriculture monitoring system</h3>
                    <p>Smart agriculture monitoring system or simply 
                        smart farming is an emerging technology 
                        concept where data from several agricultural 
                        fields are collected using smart electronic sensor.</p>
                    <p>Smart agriculture using an IOT system is 
                        powered by Arduino it consists of a 
                        Temperature sensor, Moisture sensor, and 
                        water level sensor.</p>
                    <p>Once data is collected from all the sensors 
                        it can be formulated to water the plant on 
                        a timely manner.</p>

                    <h3>Automatic Number Plate Recognition[ANPR]</h3>
                    <p>Automatic number-plate recognition is a 
                        technology that uses optical character 
                        recognition on images to read vehicle 
                        registration plates.</p>
                    <p>It is also used for electronic toll 
                        collection on highway roads and to 
                        catalog traffic movements.</p>
                    <p>It first uses a series of image manipulation 
                        techniques to detect, normalize and enhance 
                        the image of the number plate, and then 
                        optical character recognition (OCR) to 
                        extract the alphanumerical of the license plate.</p>
